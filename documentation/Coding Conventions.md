# Coding Conventions
## Why do we need coding conventions?
It may seem like a trivial thing but setting up some conventions on how to name things like classes and files, and other code constructs, can make working with your codebase a lot more pleasant and efficient. Without even thinking about it you will begin to recognize what things are by how they are formatted or named, or where they are located in your codebase.

## Dart style
Many languages define conventions for you these days, and it is worth the effort of learning them and using them. The conventions may not cover all situations, in which case you may want to extend the conventions to suit your team's needs. If you do, make sure you document them, and the rationale, in a document like this. 

The creators of Dart have defined a set conventions that they think make sense when developing in Dart. A summary of the conventions, with links to details, can be found here: [summary of all rules](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/effective-dart#summary-of-all-rules)
